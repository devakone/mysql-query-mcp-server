# MySQL MCP Server Test Fixes

This document describes the issues that were fixed in the test suite of the MySQL MCP Server project.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Exported the `isReadOnlyQuery` function in query.ts**:
   - The function was being imported in the tests but wasn't exported from the source file
   - Fixed by adding the `export` keyword to the function declaration

2. **Fixed the Mocking Approach**:
   - Previous test implementation was using `vi.mocked()` which was causing type errors
   - The mocks were not properly set up for the connection and query methods
   - We simplified the mock implementation with pure JavaScript functions instead of relying on jest/vitest mocking APIs

3. **Simplified Test State Management**:
   - Added global variables to track mock state (e.g., `releaseCalled`, `queryCount`)
   - Used these variables to verify that the expected operations were performed
   - Made tests more readable and less brittle

4. **Fixed the `info.ts` Module**:
   - The module was creating its own pools instead of importing from db/pools.js
   - Updated to import the pools from the correct location, making it consistent with other modules

## Improved Test Patterns

The tests now use a more reliable approach:

1. **Manual Mocking**: Instead of relying on mock functions with `mockResolvedValueOnce`, etc., we use pure JavaScript functions with conditional logic.

2. **Clear State Management**: Each test resets the mock state before running, preventing test interdependence.

3. **Fixed Environmental Setup**: Tests now properly set up the environment and clean up after themselves.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with:

```bash
npm test
```

All tests now pass successfully.
